Add")print("2. Subtract") print("3. Multiply")print("4. Divide")while True:    choice = input("Enter choice (1/2/3/4): ")    if choice in ('1', '2', '3', '4'):        try:            num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))            num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))        except ValueError:            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")            continue        if choice == '1':            print(num1, "+", num2, "=", add(num1, num2))        elif choice == '2':            print(num1, "-", num2, "=", subtract(num1, num2))        elif choice == '3':            print(num1, "*", num2, "=", multiply(num1, num2))        elif choice == '4':            print(num1, "/", num2, "=", divide(num1, num2))                next_calculation = input("Do another calculation? (yes/no): ")        if next_calculation.lower() == "no":            break    else:        print("Invalid input")```This calculator:- Handles basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)- Validates user input- Allows multiple calculations in sequence- Handles decimal numbers- Includes error checking for invalid inputs[^2][^2]: [Programiz - Python Program to Make a Simple Calculator](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/calculator)
